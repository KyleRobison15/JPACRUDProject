This route is nice to do in the cooler months, as it\'s in the sun all day. Approach as to \"The Brass Wall.\" This route is on \"Brass Wall Left.\" The first pitch is also the start of a climb called \"The Big Horn.\" Starts on a ledge with a single scrub oak.\n\nPitch 1: Climb the obvious crack which shoots up to the big ledge. Continue up the well-protected varnished crack/face with lots of features for hands and feet. This pitch loves nuts! Climb straight up to the big ledge with a scrub oak. Bolted anchors. 5.6.\n\nPitch 2: Stay right of the chimney (the chimney to the left of the anchors is the start of pitch 2 of The Big Horn.) Start on the face above the anchors. Climb up to a left-facing corner. There are a couple of little offwidth moves in this section. Stay right at the top of the chimney, stepping out of the alcove, then move left into the crack, climbing up to a ledge with loose rock and a bolted anchor. 5.7.\n\nPitch 3: Climb up about 10 feet and look to your left, for a left-leaning, right-facing corner/ramp. Follow the fun, narrow ramp, continuing to traverse left, to a protection bolt. The pro a little tricky before the bolt: nuts in not too obvious seams. Move a little left of the bolt, then go straight up to the thin right-facing corner and up right to a ledge with bolted anchors. 5.7+.\n\nPitch 4: Climb up and traverse right about 20-30 feet heading for black varnished face holds. Climb up the black varnished face, following the path of least resistance, to a belay at a small stance. The P4 belay can not be seen until about 15 feet from it. A good amount of gear can be had on this pitch. 5.6.\n\nNote: Don\'t go straight up from the belay; the climbing peters out into unprotectable face climbing on less than inspiring white/orange rock.\n\nPitch 5: From the belay look up and right 60 feet or more for a light brown 2-3 ft roof (about 20-30 feet to the right of the belay). Birdland goes just left of the edge of that roof and up the nice crack that is above the roof and out of sight. This pitch ends with a beautiful finger crack to a triangular stepping stool to reach the anchors. The last moves to the belay are the crux. Fight for this pitch! 5.7+.\n\nNote: On pitch 5 do not go up and left. From the belay one can see white slings on an anchor about 30-40 feet left. This anchor is for a new route and not Birdland.\n\nPitch 6: 5.7R, that I haven\'t done, which consists of climbing on loose rock, to an anchor. If someone would like to post the beta for pitch 6, that\'ll be great. [admin\'s note: best to pass on pitch 6-- loose rock directly above the belayer, minimal pro, etc. Way out of character with the rest of the route.]\n\nRap the route with two ropes or with one 70m rope.', 'NV', 'Red Rock', 'Pine Creek Canyon', 'Brass Wall', 36.124, -115.49, 1, 5, '2021-01-24', DEFAULT, DEFAULT);

Go up this crack until the angle slacks off into a sandy slab to the bottom of a large left-facing corner. Do not go up the corner. Step out onto the featured face on the right, where you\'ll find a bolt after a couple yards. Keep heading up to another station in an unvarnished patch at the base of the beautiful chocolate pitch. ~165\', 5.9.\n\nP3: The money pitch. Step right, then head straight up on varnished plates forever. Load up the cracks with nuts and enjoy a rope length of perfect rock. ~160\', sustained 5.6.\n\nP4: Trend left off the belay, then follow the varnish up until stepping right on a ledge to another station. ~95\', 5.6.\n\nP5: Climb the arete above the ledge, passing three bolts along the way. You\'ll come to to a very large ledge, the Humorous Ledge. ~80\', 5.7\n\nP6: Mantle the large block by going directly up the face for a fun V1-ish boulder problem or just scramble up the side. Continue up the arete passing another two bolts to an anchor. ~100\', 5.6\n\nFrom here, scramble west towards a gully marked with some cairns. Be careful as it is somewhat exposed and there are few places where you definitely do not want to fall. Scramble up the gully and to the top of Juniper Peak.\n\nDescent: There is a very quick walk-off from Juniper Peak. First, ensure you are standing on the summit proper of Juniper Peak (marked with cairns and an ammo can cache). Face Vegas and then walk to your left. There will be a trail marked with cairns. Follow the trail back down to the base. Do not try descending before reaching the true summit as there is a very well marked trail descending S/SW into Pine Creek that will not take you to the base of Armatron.', 'NV', 'Red Rock', 'Juniper Canyon', 'Brownstone Wall', 36.114, -115.487, 1, 5, '2021-01-22', DEFAULT, DEFAULT);

Take the new trail and head to the left (North) side of the tower to bypass the short cliff band. It should be noted that this cliff band is fun to down-climb in the dark, so you may not want to miss it. After bouldering up a short, exposed bit, head left towards the route - a big, fat dihedral on the South side as you approach the tower.\n\nP1 - this is a 140 foot, 5.easy pitch that splits into 4 sections. It starts at a wide dihedral crack/chimney system, goes up about 20 feet to a big ledge and continues past a bulge. Head slightly left to a fat dihedral/squeeze chimney that puts you onto another almost as big ledge (2 bolt rap anchor on the right). Continue up another short chimney to a belay at yet another big ledge (gear anchor). 5.6, 140\'.\n\nP2 - head up the obvious crack system. It is weird and is more or less a double crack system. After ~20\', the left crack goes up past a bolt and continues as Black Sun. The right crack is the original line; however, you could continue up Black Sun a bit further and angle right later. You\'ll figure-out how to do it. Double #4 Camalots and a bit of leap-frogging can make this more reasonable. Note, face climb around some large, loose blocks in the last 25\' of this pitch. Be very careful with these, they shift. This pitch also takes a couple of bomber medium to large stoppers towards the top. At the end of this pitch, you will be placed at a ledge with a bolted belay. Oh yeah, it\'s honest 5.8, 100\'.\n\nP3 - this is the business (true 5.9). Most of it is wide, but most of the protection is not. All I can say is don\'t get tunnel vision at the crux, which has the 3rd bolt near it. If you are a runt like me, you can squeeze into the chimney after the crux and feel secure. If not, there are face climbing options on polished calcite. There are protection options deep in the chimney. This pitch is where I got to hear my German friend curse in two languages - it was awesome. You arrive at a 3 bolt anchor. 5.9, 3 updated protection bolts & gear, 110\'.\n\nP4 - you can either do 5.7 face with a hand or foot traverse right or the 5.similar chimney to the left. Definitely do the chimney if someone in your party is not a trad climber. You can easily watch them flail. This pitch is not too long compared to the 2nd and 3rd. There is a 2 bolt anchor just below the summit. You\'ll have to pee by now, so go ahead and get on the summit (on belay of course). 5.8, 80\'.\n\nThe route does go into the shade mid to late afternoon. It can be blazing hot in the quiet sun to unpredictably cold in the shade and wind, so be prepared. This route can be incredibly popular with even foreigners queuing up. Fortunately, you can descend from most points quite easily.\n\nWe descended this thing in 3 raps. From the top anchor, rap to the end of the 2nd pitch (2 ropes). From there, go to the top of the 1st pitch. Then it\'s 90\' to the start. You can rap this route with a 70m rope in 4 rappels (80\', 105\', 140\' (with a short belayed downclimb), 90\').\n\nYou can also rap the North Face in 3 rappels with double ropes.', 'UT', 'Moab', 'Castle Valley', 'Castleton Tower', 38.651, -109.368, 0, NULL, NULL, DEFAULT, DEFAULT);

With that said I want to thank Richard, Mark, and Koko for their excellent route Solid Gold. Their efforts on solid gold are the only reason this route was even possible. So we Thank You.\n\nStart with the first 2 pitches of Solid Gold. I recommend linking both for a full value 200 foot rope-stretcher. This either takes a lot of draws, or some discipline to skip a few bolts through easier terrain (Make sure your belayer is tied in and ready to go, and you belay from the lower of 2 anchors on the ledge.)\n\nP1: (5.9, bolts, 100 feet) this is a 100 foot pitch that goes on bolts and finishes at a double bolt anchor. The rock is solid all the way and kicks out a couple of fun spots.\n\nP2: (5.8, bolts, 100 feet) is also 100 foot long and is largely quite easy with a couple of 5.8 sections, one right off the belay. It finishes on a ledge at a double bolt belay stance. However, for descent purposes, a higher rap anchor was installed that keeps the rope running clean and off the ledge. This stance is ten feet higher than the belay stance.\n\nP3: (5.7, 2 bolts, 40 feet) this is essentially a pitch to move your anchor slightly higher before stepping over to Playin\' Hooky. Belay on the large grassy ledge at a 2 bolt anchor.\n\nP4 (5.8, 14 bolts, 150 feet) time for some exposure! Step right from the belay, clip the first bolt, dodge a bush, and embark on 140 feet of fun climbing with a steep exposed finale.
